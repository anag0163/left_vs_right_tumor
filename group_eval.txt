How did you do on this project?

I did alright on this project. While we did pass all 
the test cases to our knowledge, we realize that our 
design lacked some foresight, in terms of the parsing 
and tokenizing.



What did you learn?

I learned about the benefits of designing code early on 
and reading about the full functionality of a function 
via man pages before using the functions.



What did your group do well?

Our group met early, so we didn't have to procastinate 
towards the end. We also regularly scheduled meetings to 
discuss bugs. We took breaks, especially when debugging 
the last testcase, which really helped. We also rewrote 
the code to fix the last testcase, which was a great choice.



What would you do differently in the next project?

Design code for longer, and read about any system calls or 
library calls in greater detail. Additionally, spend a day 
reading the project description in full detail and asking 
questions.

Explanation of rating:

Ishita has a very good rating because she was always prompt in 
attending meetings, excited to start new tasks on the project, 
and very supportive whenever we had bugs. She also had good design
